Nebulance Systems BootCamp DevOps Class2025A

📌 Project Summary

This project is about building and deploying a Flask Visitor Counter Web Application. Every time someone visits the webpage, a counter goes up by one and stores this data in a MongoDB database.

You are not just building the app — you are containerizing it using Docker and Docker Compose so it can run anywhere, anytime.

✅ Expected Outcome

Web app running at: http://localhost:5050
Big counter showing number of visitors
Buttons to:
Refresh and count visits
View health and metrics
Reset counter
Data stored in MongoDB and persists even after restarting
Clear MongoDB connection status shown on the interface
📚 Key Terms Explained

Flask – A Python tool used to build simple web apps.
Python – A general-purpose, beginner-friendly programming language.
Visitor Counter – Keeps track of how many people visit the page.
MongoDB – A database that stores data in JSON-like format.
PyMongo – Python tool that lets Flask communicate with MongoDB.
Bootstrap – Makes the web interface responsive and modern.
Docker – Packages your app and its environment in a “container.”
Dockerfile – A script that tells Docker how to build the container.
Docker Compose – Helps run multiple containers (Flask + MongoDB) together.
Volume – Keeps MongoDB data safe even when containers stop.
Environment Variables – Configurable app values in a .env file (like DB name, port).
Health Check – Confirms the app and DB are working.
Graceful Degradation – If MongoDB is down, the app still loads but shows a degraded status.

🧾 .env File

Used to configure environment settings like port and database.

FLASK_ENV=development DEBUG=True PORT=5000 MONGODB_HOST=mongodb MONGODB_PORT=27017 MONGODB_DB=visitor_counter

📦 Dockerfile

Used to build the container image for the Flask application.

FROM python:3.10-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt . RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

EXPOSE 5000 ENV FLASK_ENV=production

CMD ["flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0", "--port=5000"]

📂 docker-compose.yml Used to run Flask and MongoDB together. version: '3.8'

🧪 How the App Works (app.py Summary) • Starts a web server using Flask. • Connects to MongoDB using environment values. • Routes include: o / — Displays the homepage and updates the visitor count o /health — Returns JSON health status o /metrics — Returns visit stats o /reset — Resets the counter

🚀 Step-by-Step Deployment Guide

Open VS Code and Clone the Repo git clone https://github.com/Highshow14/Flask-visitor-counter-web-application.git cd bootcamp-project-1
Check if Docker Is Installed docker --version You should see something like Docker version 24.0.0.
Install and start docker desktop on your local machine

Build and Run the Containers docker-compose up --build -d Explanation: • --build builds the image using Dockerfile • -d runs in the background

Access the Application Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:5050 You should see the web dashboard.
Test API Endpoints curl http://localhost:5050/health curl http://localhost:5050/metrics curl -X POST http://localhost:5050/reset Each returns a JSON response with status or data.
Test Data Persistence docker-compose stop docker-compose start -d
Simulate MongoDB Failure to test data persistence Stop MongoDB: docker stop mongodb Now refresh the web page. MongoDB status will show as "Disconnected" and app status will be "Degraded". To bring it back: docker start mongodb Refresh again to reconnect. This stops the container and restarts it. Visitor count should still be there — thanks to volume storage. This confirms your data persistence.
Push to GitHub git add . git commit -m "Final flask project" git push

✅ Success Criteria • Application loads at http://localhost:5050 • Visitor counter increments with each visit • MongoDB stays connected and data is saved • /health, /metrics, /reset endpoints work • Restarting does not reset the counter
